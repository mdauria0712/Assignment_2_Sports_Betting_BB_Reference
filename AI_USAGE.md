Here were the prompts used to create this web scraper:
- First, used "make me a quick and simple selenium testing script that will just open up the home page of basketball reference" (with Anish's help) just to see if selenium could open up the site we wanted to scrape.
- I then prompted "it opens up basketball reference now. can you take the previous instructions i gave you to scrape the site to be able to output the top 5 players in each category for ppg, rpg, 3pm, and maybe a couple more big player props that people like to bet on" to try to build up a scraper using the previous code logic
- I initially received the following message which I prompted the LLM with "2025-09-15 18:40:06,346 - Fetching NBA 2024 per-game stats from https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_per_game.html 2025-09-15 18:40:12,113 - Could not find per-game stats table in comments 2025-09-15 18:40:12,130 - No player data scraped null" and in response, the code was rewritten to look for this info inside of a comment block because that is how the site formats its HTML. BeautifulSoup is then used to parse all the information and find what we need (stats).
At one point, there was a bug where the 3PM was printing the wrong statistic so I looked at the table where the info was, and realized that if i changed the number by 1, it would move over one column where the correct information was. That solved the issue of the 3PM being printed in the wrong ranking.
Also, the majority of the information in the docs section was AI generated with the prompts being the instructions given on the doc
Everything not mentioned above was done by my partner, Mike, and I.
