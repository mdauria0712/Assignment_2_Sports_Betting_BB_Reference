For our project, we decided to create a platform to help provide more innovative sports betting strategies and bets for our customers. Many sports betters are influenced by the possibility of winning and other psychological influencers. This leads to flawed decision-making processes and cognitive biases that ultimately hurt the better's probability of winning. In an article by Immunize Nevada called “The Psychology Of Sports Betting: Understanding Risk And Reward”, they mention cognitive biases such as “Confirmation bias, gambler’s fallacy, overconfidence bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, and present bias(Immunize Nevada)” as ways gamblers overvalue specific bets that can lead to financial loss. This financial loss can also lead to destructive behaviours that can lead to further significant economic losses and addiction, affecting their personal life. Our company wants to provide data-based advice to customers to help them make smarter decisions.
