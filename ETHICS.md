Legal Analysis Terms of Use & Robots.txt Our project scrapes Basketball-Reference.com, which explicitly allows automated access within published limits (≤20 requests/minute) but prohibits creating a competing product, reselling data, or training AI models without permission. We stayed under this rate limit and cached results locally to minimize load. Relevant Laws & Cases Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. § 1030 – prohibits “unauthorized access” to protected computers. Since Basketball-Reference is publicly accessible and we did not bypass authentication, scraping within published limits is unlikely to violate CFAA. Contract Law – Terms of Use act as a contract; we followed their restrictions by using limited requests and not redistributing data. Copyright Law (17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.) – Facts (like box scores) are not copyrightable per Feist Publ’ns v. Rural Tel. Serv., 499 U.S. 340 (1991), but the site’s compilation/formatting may be protected. We used the data solely for educational purposes and not for republication. Case Precedent: hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn, 938 F.3d 985 (9th Cir. 2019) ruled that scraping publicly available web pages does not constitute CFAA “hacking,” provided no circumvention of authentication occurs — supporting our use case.
Impact on Website Operations We scraped one page for this project, well under the 20 requests per minute limit they set. We inserted randomized delays (time.sleep()) between requests and cached data to avoid re-scraping. Result: negligible server impact, no risk of degrading human users’ experience, and full compliance with site guidance.
Privacy Considerations The scraped data contains only publicly available sports statistics — no personal user data.
Our Ethical Framework We applied these principles throughout the project: Respect for Terms of Use – Stayed below rate limits, did not create a competing product, and cited the data source. Transparency – Documented scraping methodology, legal considerations, and the respect of sports reference as they provide a free-to-use and helpful service for sports fans.
Educational Intent – The project is for a university course, not for profit or public distribution, just as a hypothetical company for academic purposes. We acknowledge the additional steps and requirements needed to make this company real.
Alternative Approaches Considered We looked into using different sports data websites, but many of them prohibited web scraping policies and required either payment or permission to allow web scraping access.
